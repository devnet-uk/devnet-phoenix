# ADR-001: Clean Architecture Implementation

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-09-06  
**Authors**: Phoenix Team  
**Reviewers**: Engineering OS Team  

## Context

Phoenix requires a robust, maintainable architecture that can scale from initial development through enterprise deployment. The system needs to support 436+ features across multiple development phases while maintaining high code quality, testability, and long-term maintainability.

### Background

Traditional monolithic architectures often lead to:
- High coupling between business logic and frameworks
- Difficulty in testing business rules in isolation
- Framework lock-in and migration challenges
- Scalability issues as the system grows
- Maintenance nightmares in large codebases

Phoenix is a greenfield rebuild targeting 10/10 architectural compliance with embedded verification framework integration.

## Decision

**We will implement Clean Architecture as defined by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) with strict layer separation and the dependency rule.**

### What we decided

Implement a 4-layer Clean Architecture:

1. **Domain Layer** (`packages/core`): Business entities, value objects, domain services
2. **Use Cases Layer**: Application services, business workflows  
3. **Interface Adapters** (`packages/api`): Controllers, presenters, gateways
4. **Frameworks Layer** (`apps/web`): Web frameworks, databases, external services

### Why we decided this

- **Testability**: Domain layer achieves 100% test coverage with zero dependencies
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and explicit dependencies
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap frameworks without affecting business logic
- **Engineering OS Compliance**: Aligns with embedded verification framework
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports growth from startup to enterprise
- **Team Development**: Clear boundaries enable parallel development

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Traditional Layered Architecture
- **Pros**: Familiar to most developers, simple to understand
- **Cons**: Often leads to anemic domain models and framework coupling
- **Why rejected**: Doesn't meet our 10/10 architectural compliance target

### Option 2: Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
- **Pros**: Good separation between core and external concerns
- **Cons**: Can be complex to implement, less standardized than Clean Architecture
- **Why rejected**: Clean Architecture provides more specific guidance for our needs

### Option 3: Microservices from the Start
- **Pros**: Ultimate scalability and service independence
- **Cons**: Premature complexity, network overhead, distributed system challenges
- **Why rejected**: Over-engineering for initial development phases

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **High testability**: Domain layer reaches 100% coverage with fast unit tests
- **Framework independence**: Can migrate from Next.js/HonoJS without core changes
- **Clear development guidelines**: Explicit rules about what goes where
- **Maintainable codebase**: Reduced coupling leads to easier modifications
- **Embedded verification**: Architecture compliance can be automatically verified
- **Team scalability**: Clear boundaries enable multiple teams to work in parallel

### Negative Consequences

- **Initial complexity**: Higher learning curve for developers new to Clean Architecture
- **More boilerplate**: Interface definitions and mappers between layers
- **Performance overhead**: Additional abstraction layers may impact performance
- **Strict discipline required**: Easy to violate dependency rules without vigilance

### Neutral Consequences

- **Different project structure**: Packages organized by architectural layer, not feature
- **More interfaces**: Explicit contracts between layers increase interface count
- **Testing strategy changes**: Different testing approaches for each layer

## Implementation

### Immediate Actions

- [x] Package structure organized by architectural layers
- [x] Dependency rules enforced via package.json dependencies
- [x] TypeScript path mapping for clean imports
- [x] ESLint rules to prevent architectural violations

### Future Considerations

- **Phase 1**: Implement pure domain layer with 100% test coverage
- **Phase 2**: Add use cases and application services
- **Phase 3**: Infrastructure implementations (repositories, external services)
- **Phase 4**: Interface adapters (API controllers, presenters)
- **Performance monitoring**: Track if abstraction overhead becomes significant
- **Developer training**: Ensure team understands Clean Architecture principles

## Compliance and Verification

### Engineering OS Standards

- **Standards consulted**: `architecture/clean-architecture.md`, `architecture/domain-driven-design.md`
- **Embedded verification**: Dependency direction rules enforced automatically
- **Compliance requirements**: 10/10 Clean Architecture compliance score

### Testing Strategy

- **Domain layer**: 100% unit test coverage, zero dependencies
- **Use cases**: 95% coverage with domain integration tests
- **Interface adapters**: 95% coverage with API contract tests
- **Frameworks**: E2E tests for complete user journeys

## Related ADRs

- **Related to**: ADR-002 (Monorepo Structure) - Enables per-layer packages
- **Related to**: ADR-003 (TypeScript Strict Mode) - Enforces type safety across layers
- **May influence**: Future ADRs on domain modeling and service design

## Notes

This decision establishes the foundational architecture for Phoenix. All subsequent architectural decisions should align with Clean Architecture principles and the dependency rule.

The embedded verification framework will continuously monitor compliance with these architectural decisions through automated testing of dependency directions and layer isolation.
