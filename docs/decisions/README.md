# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Phoenix, documenting important architectural decisions made during development. ADRs help maintain context for future developers and ensure architectural consistency.

## ADR Format

We use the standard ADR template with the following sections:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The circumstances that led to the decision
- **Decision**: What we decided to do
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative consequences

## Current ADRs

### Phase 0: Infrastructure & Project Setup

- [ADR-001: Clean Architecture Implementation](001-clean-architecture.md)
- [ADR-002: Monorepo Structure with pnpm Workspaces](002-monorepo-structure.md)
- [ADR-003: TypeScript Strict Mode Configuration](003-typescript-strict.md)
- [ADR-004: Embedded Verification Framework](004-embedded-verification.md)
- [ADR-005: Development Environment Standards](005-development-environment.md)

### Phase 1: Core Domain Layer (Coming Soon)

- ADR-006: Domain Entity Design Patterns
- ADR-007: Value Object Implementation Strategy
- ADR-008: Domain Service Architecture
- ADR-009: Domain Event Handling

### Future Phases

Additional ADRs will be added as architectural decisions are made throughout Phoenix development phases.

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. **Copy the template**: Use [template.md](template.md) as starting point
2. **Number sequentially**: Use next available ADR number
3. **Write clear context**: Explain the problem and constraints
4. **Document the decision**: What you decided and why
5. **Consider consequences**: Both positive and negative impacts
6. **Review with team**: Get feedback before finalizing
7. **Update this README**: Add your ADR to the appropriate section

## ADR Guidelines

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR for decisions that:

- **Impact architecture**: Structural changes to the system
- **Affect multiple packages**: Cross-cutting concerns
- **Have long-term consequences**: Difficult to reverse later
- **Involve trade-offs**: Different options with pros/cons
- **Set precedents**: Establish patterns for future development

### Writing Quality ADRs

**Good ADRs**:
- ✅ Explain the problem clearly
- ✅ Consider multiple alternatives
- ✅ Document trade-offs and consequences
- ✅ Include relevant context and constraints
- ✅ Are concise but comprehensive

**Poor ADRs**:
- ❌ State decisions without context
- ❌ Ignore alternatives or trade-offs
- ❌ Are too vague or too detailed
- ❌ Don't explain the "why"
- ❌ Lack consideration of consequences

## ADR Status Meanings

- **Proposed**: Decision is under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision is approved and being implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended but may still be in use
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Architecture Principles

Phoenix ADRs should align with our core principles:

1. **Clean Architecture**: Dependency rule and layer separation
2. **Domain-Driven Design**: Business logic isolation
3. **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript safety
4. **Testability**: High coverage with quality tests
5. **Performance**: Optimal user and developer experience
6. **Maintainability**: Long-term code health
7. **Engineering OS Integration**: Standards compliance

## Review Process

1. **Author creates ADR**: Draft with "Proposed" status
2. **Team review**: Architecture and engineering review
3. **Discussion period**: Gather feedback and refine
4. **Final review**: Senior architecture approval
5. **Status update**: Change to "Accepted" when approved
6. **Implementation tracking**: Monitor adherence during development

**Note**: ADRs are living documents. Update them as decisions evolve, but maintain historical context by creating new ADRs that supersede previous ones rather than editing approved ADRs.
