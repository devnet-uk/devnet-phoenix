# Phoenix Implementation Plan - Local Reference

## üìç Single Source of Truth

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This file is a **reference pointer only**.

**Master Implementation Plan**: `~/Projects/devnet.clean_architecture/phoenix-plan/phoenix.md`

All Phoenix implementation status, phase tracking, and dispatcher logic is maintained in the Engineering OS repository. This ensures a single source of truth and prevents synchronization issues.

## Current Status Reference

For the most up-to-date status, always check:
```bash
# View current status
cat ~/Projects/devnet.clean_architecture/PHOENIX-CHECKPOINT.txt

# View detailed progress  
cat ~/Projects/devnet.clean_architecture/PHOENIX-PROGRESS.md

# Access master dispatcher
cat ~/Projects/devnet.clean_architecture/phoenix-plan/phoenix.md
```

## Quick Start Commands

Continue Phoenix implementation from the master dispatcher:
```bash
cd ~/Projects/devnet.clean_architecture/
Continue Phoenix from phoenix-plan/phoenix.md
```

Or continue from checkpoint:
```bash
cd ~/Projects/devnet.clean_architecture/
Continue Phoenix implementation from checkpoint
```

## Why Single Source of Truth?

- **No Sync Issues**: Only one file to update
- **Consistent State**: Always current across workspaces  
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Engineering OS handles all status tracking
- **Authoritative Reference**: Clear hierarchy of documentation

**Implementation happens in**: `~/Projects/devnet-phoenix/` (this repo)  
**Status tracking happens in**: `~/Projects/devnet.clean_architecture/` (Engineering OS repo)
