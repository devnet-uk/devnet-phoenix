# Phoenix Implementation Plan

This is the Phoenix implementation plan reference within the Phoenix repository.

## Status
âœ… **Phase 0 Step 1**: Repository Infrastructure (Complete)
ðŸŸ¡ **Phase 0 Step 2**: Monorepo Architecture Specification (Next)

## Implementation Overview

Phoenix follows the Engineering OS framework with 7 implementation phases:

### Phase 0: Infrastructure & Project Setup
- âœ… **Step 1**: Repository Infrastructure Specification (Complete)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Step 2**: Monorepo Architecture Specification (Next)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Step 3**: Core Packages Architecture Specification
- ðŸŸ¡ **Step 4**: Development Environment Specification  
- ðŸŸ¡ **Step 5**: Project Documentation Specification

### Future Phases (436 features total)
- **Phase 1**: Core Domain Layer (100% coverage target)
- **Phase 2**: Use Cases & Business Logic (95% coverage)
- **Phase 3**: Infrastructure Layer (95% coverage)
- **Phase 4**: Interface Adapters (95% coverage)
- **Phase 5**: Presentation Layer (95% coverage)
- **Phase 6**: Deployment & Launch
- **Phase 7**: Documentation & Optimization

## Architecture Compliance

- **Clean Architecture**: 10/10 compliance target
- **Coverage**: 98% overall (100% domain, 95% infrastructure/UI)
- **Framework**: Engineering OS with embedded verification
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with layer-specific thresholds

## Engineering OS Integration

This plan integrates with the comprehensive Phoenix implementation plan located at:
`~/Projects/devnet.clean_architecture/phoenix-plan/phoenix.md`

The Engineering OS repository contains the master dispatcher and detailed phase implementation plans, while this file serves as a local reference within the Phoenix repository.

## Current Implementation Status

**Repository Infrastructure (Complete)**:
- âœ… Git repository with conventional commits
- âœ… Monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces
- âœ… Development environment with VS Code configuration
- âœ… Testing framework with Vitest and coverage thresholds
- âœ… Quality gates with pre-commit hooks and lint-staged
- âœ… Documentation with comprehensive developer guides
- âœ… Engineering OS compliance verification

**Ready for Phase 0 Step 2**: Monorepo Architecture Specification

## Next Steps

Continue Phoenix implementation from the Engineering OS repository:
```bash
cd ~/Projects/devnet.clean_architecture/
Continue Phoenix from phoenix-plan/phoenix.md
```

This will load the next phase of implementation with proper Engineering OS standards consultation and verification framework integration.
